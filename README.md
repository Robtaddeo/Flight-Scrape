# Flight Scrape

Flight Scrape is a program that uses skiplagged to scrape data and compare flights from two different cities

NOTE: if you run too many queries skiplagged.com might cut off your connection and you will have to wait a couple minutes before you can run again

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install selenium.

```bash
pip install selenium
```

You also might need to change chromedrivers permissions to 755 like this: 

```bash
chmod chromedriver 0755
```

You can run Flight Scrape as a jupyter notebook or a python executable. Run Flight Scrape from the terminal like this:

```bash
python flight_scrape.py
```
